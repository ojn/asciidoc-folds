# Keybindings require three things to be fully defined: A selector that is
# matched against the focused element, the keystroke and the command to
# execute.
#
# Below is a basic keybinding which registers on all platforms by applying to
# the root workspace element.

# For more detailed documentation see
# https://atom.io/docs/latest/behind-atom-keymaps-in-depth
#
# Here are some example keybindings. They are commented, because it's almost impossible to predict which bindings
# are most appropriate for all individuals. So, set up your own bindings or use the follwing bindings in your
# personal settings
